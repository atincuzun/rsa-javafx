This project encrypts and decrypts the given text file according to RSA. The user must start by generating encryption and decrpytion keys first. This can be done by clicking to the "Generate Keys" button.The user can input text in the given textfield and get the resulting encrypted text.Then, to confirm that encrpytion and decrpytion actually works, the same encrypted text with the same public/private key pair can be decrypted.After generating the keys, the user can also input the given text file to encrypt using the "Choose file to encrypt" button. The output is created with "_encrypted" suffix in the same directory.Using the decrpytion key, which has been generated as a pair along with encryption key, the text file can be decrypted using "Choose file to decrypt" button.  If the keys are not generated first before using the program, an exception occurs.
